# hull2d-startup

Ethan Fox and Afamdi Achufusi

The more complete description of this project can be found in the PDF of the Latex file we created.

## How to run the project

The setup of the files is largely unchanged from the starter setup. To compile, running "make" should do it. To run the program, run "./hull2d" with the number of points N you want to generate as an argument. For example, "./hull2d 1000" will generate 1000 points and run the program on them.

Pressing "q" will quit the program.
Pressing "i" will toggle between all of the different sets of test cases included in the program.
